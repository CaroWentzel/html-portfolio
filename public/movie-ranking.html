<h1>Must Watch Horror movies</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Top 3 to watch first:</h2>

<h3>1. Raging Grace</h3>
<p>
  Suspenseful tale with a horror twist layer-by-layer, showing us Joy’s
  hardships, establishing Grace’s rebellious phase, and immersing us in their
  problems until what looks like divine intervention arrives that’s almost too
  good to be true (and it is).
</p>
<h3>2. Midsommar</h3>
<p>
  MidSommar shows us a group of friends going on what seems like an idyllic trip
  to the Midsummer festival in a village in Northern Sweden. But that quickly
  turns into a harrowing display of Pagan rituals and ceremonies.
</p>
<h3>3. High Life</h3>
<p>
  A group of prisoners being used as guinea pigs in a deep space mission. The
  story begins pretty far along in the life of its main character, Pattinson's
  Monte, a convict turned astronaut. He's first seen living alone on the
  aforementioned deep space vessel, a dark and messy place plagued by technical
  problems, taking care of a little girl named Willow.
